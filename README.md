# Collatz Conjecture Sequence Generator

## Overview
This Java program generates a sequence based on the Collatz conjecture, also known as the Syracuse suite. The Collatz conjecture is a sequence defined for positive integers, where each term in the sequence is obtained from the previous term according to certain rules.

## Instructions
1. **Clone Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone [repository_url]
     ```

2. **Compile the Code:**
   - Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
   - Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
   - Compile the code using the following command:
     ```bash
     javac Main.java
     ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   - Run the compiled program with the following command:
     ```bash
     java Main
     ```
   - Enter a positive integer when prompted.

4. **View Collatz Sequence:**
   - The program will print the generated Collatz sequence for the entered number.

## Code Explanation
- The `CollatzConjecture` class contains the recursive method `seqGenerate`, which generates the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer.
- The `Main` class is responsible for taking user input, creating an instance of `CollatzConjecture`, and displaying the generated sequence.

## Example Usage
```bash
Enter a positive integer: 10
10 5 16 8 4 2 1
```

## Note
- Ensure that you enter a positive integer as input.
- The program will print each term in the Collatz sequence until it reaches 1.
